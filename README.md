### A TUI based client for Soulseek

**Why?**<br>
I like Soulseek and I like the TUI aesthetic. TUIs also allow for more consistency across platforms. This means one good UI is all you need, rather than having different UIs with varying levels of success.<br>
*Progress*: Currently in its infancy, but will most likely have a Python backend and Rust frontend.
